### ABOUT ME
Yuchen Liu is an ECE PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interest mainly focuses on next-generation wireless networks, mmWave communication, 5G backhaul, WiFi-based WLAN, network robustness, and network security. Besides his research areas, he is also interested in developing network simulators such as ns-3 software, and automatic test tools.

He is currently a third-year PhD student, and works with [Prof. Douglas M. Blough](http://blough.ece.gatech.edu/) on projects of maximizing performance for mmWave wireless networks, and developing network simulators. In addition, he is an instructor of an ECE undergraduate course, and responsible for lectures and supervising labs.

### WHAT'S NEWS
* Two of our research papers have been accepted by the 22nd ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM) in 2019, which is ranked as *A* in [Core Conference Portal](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/).

* We submitted one recent paper on robust mmWave backhaul networks to [IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7693).

* One of our research papers on mmWave WiFi networks was rejected by the 25th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom), but another paper on mobile WiFi systems has been accepted as poster in ACM MobiCom 2019.
